# Maji Ndogo Visualizations Analysis

## Project Overview

Maji Ndogo is a fictual Nation in Africa, where a mighty river flows across its land, bringing life to the Citizens. Maji Ndogo was once a beacon of hope where thriving communities were built around fertile land and abundant clean water. Cities were bustling bustling urban centers brimming with promise. Today, the picture is far different. A terrible drought made clean water a luxury. Every day is a struggle as people queue for hours often in vain for their share of life's most basic necessity, water. A legacy of corruption and mismanagement choked off Maji Ndogo's lifeblood, leaving its water infrastructure in ruins. Greed blinded the government until there was nothing left. 

**A dawn follows the darkest night**. Communities rose up. Voices echoed throughout Maji Ndogo. A new government that is guided by the principles of transparency and efficiency was elected into office. This government embraces a future driven by data and truth. The first mission was clear, *To restore the flow of water in Maji Ndogo*. 

Data-driven decisions are being made after a sweeping water survey was conducted across provinces, towns, and countless water sources that mapped out Maji Ndogo's thirst. The survey resulted in the dataset used in this project to analyze Maji Ndogo's water resources. The project is aimed at restoring the flow of water in Maji Ndogo and with it life, through data-driven insights that will guide the redevelopment plan of Maji Ndogo's water resources.
